Normally programming language books start with lots of printing like Hello World and input a word and putput a word etc. However, I am writing this set of tests for a person who understands the mathematical concepts underlying programming and is looking to implement a set of intelligent operations. Such data processing will overlap more with algorithms and data transformation. We will hence cover that more.
